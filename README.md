# Operating-Systems-TAU
In this semeseter (5th semester) of my B.Sc. Computer Science & Mathematics at Tel Aviv University, I participate in the course "Workshop in Information Security".

In this course we study the designing and implemetation of opreating systems in particular, and systems in general.
Among other topics we study: processes, files and file systems, Using mutual resources, memory management - virtual and physical memory, process scheduling, paging, and basics of computer networks.

Each directory corresponds to an assignment (out of 5 Hands-on assignments) which was given as part of the course.
In each directory you may find the guidelines (i.e. descripition of each assignment), and my solution for it.
This course is ongoing and the git project keeps updating.
